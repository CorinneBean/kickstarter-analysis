# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The client, Louise, recently completed a fundraising campaign for their play *Fever*. After coming close to reaching the campaign goal for their play in a short amount of time, they were interested in how other plays compared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goal.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the analysis of outcomes based on launch dates a total number of 4,064 different theater related Kickstarter campaigns were reviewed. These different campaigns took place from 2010 to 2017. Among the 4064 different Kickstarter campaigns that were analysis a total of 839 were successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the analysis of outcomes based on goals a total number of 1,047 Kickstarter campaigns were reviewed. The campaigns were narrowed down to the subcategory *Plays* and were broken down by campaign goals ranging from less than 1,000 to 50,000 or more.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges or difficulties were encountered during this analysis.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the information from the analysis one conclusion that could be drawn from this data is that Kickstarter campaigns appear to be most successful if they launch in May. Another conclusion from this information is that December appears to be the least successful campaign month, and the summer months (May-August) and October all appear to have roughly the same number of failed campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the information from the analysis one conclusion that could be drawn from this data is that Kickstarter campaigns appear to have the highest success percentage if the campaign goals are less than 1,000. There is a downward trend of success percentage as the campaign goal is increased with the highest chance of failure being at campaign goals starting at 45,000 and above. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations of this data is that the dataset has campaigns from different countries. The exchange value is not considered in this dataset for proper comparison. Another limitation is that Outcomes Based on Launch Date reviews the complete parent category of *Theater* while Outcomes based on Goals only reviews campaign goals for campaigns in the subcategory *Plays*.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible table and/or graph that could be created is one that compared the complete outcomes based on goals for the parent category *Theater* vs only evaluating the subcategory *Plays*. The same could be said for the opposite where we could create a table and/or graph to only review how the subcategory *Plays* compared to the Outcomes Based on Launch Dates.
